# EI.Study-Coding Exercises 

# 🖥️ Coding Exercise Practice by EI Study
Welcome to my coding exercise repository! This project is a collection of thoughtfully curated coding challenges, assigned by EI Study, aimed at refining my problem-solving skills and showcasing my expertise in data structures, algorithms, and efficient code practices. 🌟

# 💡 Objective
The primary goal of these exercises is to solve complex problems with optimal solutions while adhering to clean, maintainable, and scalable coding standards. Through this practice, I aim to:
Strengthen my proficiency in Java
Tackle algorithmic challenges involving time complexity, space optimization, and edge case handling
Demonstrate my ability to think critically and write efficient, production-ready code 🚀

# 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Java
Algorithms: Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Recursion, Backtracking, and more
Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Heaps, and Graphs
Version Control: Git and GitHub

# 1. 🎯 Design Patterns 
Behavioral Design Patterns
        a. Observer Pattern
           Use Case: Weather Station
        b. Strategy Pattern
           Use Case: Shopping Cart with Different Payment Methods

Creational Design Patterns
        a. Factory Pattern
           Use Case: Logistics Application
        b. Builder Pattern
